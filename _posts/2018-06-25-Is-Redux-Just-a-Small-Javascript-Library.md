Redux is known as library for states management. There are so many guides, tutorials, and videos even his documentation is pretty good. Then why am I writing this ? The reason is simple, that is to help others who may not understand with redux despite reading many tutorials about redux. Believe me, Redux is not that difficult. 

Although you will not be using this library, but there are many lessons learned from paradigm and architecture of this library and can be implemented in others libraries or frameworks.
